Read CLAUDE.md and identify Step $ARGUMENTS from the Implementation Steps.

Then:
1. Read all relevant docs/context/ and docs/skills/ files for this step
2. Use @planner to break it into sub-tasks
3. Implement each sub-task in order
4. After completing all sub-tasks, verify the step works

Rules:
- Follow the project structure exactly
- JavaScript only, DaisyUI for UI
- Do NOT implement anything from future steps
- Ask if unsure about a design decision
