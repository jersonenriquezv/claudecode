Check the current state of the Scripty project:

1. Read CLAUDE.md for the full step list
2. Check which files/folders exist in the project
3. Determine which steps are complete, in progress, or not started
4. Report status as:

```
Step 1  [✅ Complete | 🔨 In Progress | ⬜ Not Started]
Step 2  [...]
...
Step 14 [...]

Current step: X
Next action: [what to do next]
```

Do NOT implement anything. Just report status.
