Read CLAUDE.md to understand the project. Then read the relevant docs from docs/context/ and docs/skills/ for the step the user wants to implement.

The user will say a step number (1-14). Plan the implementation:

1. List every file that needs to be created or modified
2. Show the order of operations
3. Identify any dependencies or env vars needed
4. Estimate if any npm packages need to be installed
5. Ask for confirmation before starting

Do NOT start coding until the user confirms the plan.
