Review the current state of the codebase and update the relevant docs in docs/context/ to reflect any changes made.

Check:
1. `docs/context/database-schema.md` — does it match the actual Supabase schema?
2. `docs/context/api-routes.md` — do all routes listed exist? Are there new ones?
3. `docs/context/ai-prompts.md` — are the prompts up to date with what's in the code?

Only update files that have drifted from reality. Show what you changed.
